it is so windy today on their last day in the farm."

Local members of the agricultural, quarry and steelworkers' union held a rally on Tuesday afternoon calling on the police to stop work and seize all machinery used to build the wall.

In one strike, union spokesman Micky McNally said some mills have already been set on fire after the steelworkers went on strike.

Police said construction workers and railway workers were not on the roads in protest.
