oday was a good day. As of press time, I am almost 39% pregnant, so I am only 38% likely pregnant.  I am not planning on having a baby this year, but it would be great to get a healthy little girl back into school. Assuming we get a vaccine in the meantime, it would be great to get her back to school as quickly
