it is so windy today

He'll be in his grave and he'll be in my dreams

And you'll love him even more,

The part he played in all those days

'Cause I knew how to protect him

"In the midst of those is the line I'm shooting

Now you go to them you try to fight it off

And it goes against you and it goes against you and it goes against you and it goes against you
