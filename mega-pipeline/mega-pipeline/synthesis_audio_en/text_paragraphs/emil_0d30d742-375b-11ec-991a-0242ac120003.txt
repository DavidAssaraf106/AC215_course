it is so windy today that we could hardly speak to it and it was difficult to see how we could read. It was like being kicked off a plane by a flock of birds and I began to feel that if I continued it would make my whole body look like it was being stabbed in the back. It was like screaming and fighting.

"We also lost an unbelievable young girl. I'm calling her Zuzik because she looks as if she's in our hands."
