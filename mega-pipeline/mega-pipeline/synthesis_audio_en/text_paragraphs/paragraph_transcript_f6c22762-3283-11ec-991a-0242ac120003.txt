hello

A man was shot in the heart outside of Union City last month by two street cops who were following him as he entered his home in the 200 block of W. 1st Avenue.

Cpl. Jeremy Meeks was shot after he called 911 after seeing a suspect chasing a girl outside of U Street at around 4:40 p.m. last month.

The 7-year veteran of the U.S. Army Airborne has been on the force since 2011
