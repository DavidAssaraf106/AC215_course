hello it is raining now!

"Hi."

"Come, let me see. If you don't mind, if we start at 6:45, there's a little walk from here to town. It will be fine."

Haki held her breath.

"Okay. If it rains, we'll go over there later. We'll wait. Right away, I'll talk to you, if you're interested."

We tried to talk.
