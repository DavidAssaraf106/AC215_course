Hello. I like to eat fried chicken.

Kevin: I'm getting a lot of kids from my high school and I get a lot of different types of kids, but I can't afford to raise my kids at home because they're getting the same kind of attention as I am.

Andy: Well, it's amazing.

Kevin: I love eating animals.

Andy: Well, I'm trying to get an A.

Kevin: I love watching movies
