The Record Room

Union Square Park - 5pm, $10 - 7pm


Pour cassis, hors d'oeuvres and wine selection, but will be featured with Jason Chapman, Jim Michael. Also add the Southern take on classic New York's All American Barbecue. This would be a fine go-to BBQ spot for the kids and will go down as one of the best in the city. http://www.recordroom.com/
