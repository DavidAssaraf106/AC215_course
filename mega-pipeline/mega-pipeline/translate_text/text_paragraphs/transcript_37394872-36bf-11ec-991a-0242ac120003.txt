you will not believe what I saw walking home today. The picture I had was not your mother's picture.


She told me that when I was 13, I was involved in the school sexual assault case in New York. I knew it was wrong, but the fact is it was not. I was 13 years old and my mother had been convicted of some misdemeanors, including some sexual assault.

But what made you feel that something had gone terribly wrong was how you reacted.
